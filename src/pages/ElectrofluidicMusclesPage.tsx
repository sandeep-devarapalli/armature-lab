            <h3>An antagonistic fluid circuit</h3>
            <p>
              An electric field drives dielectric fluid through a helical electrohydrodynamic pump between two thin McKibben actuators. As one contracts, the opposing actuator receives fluid and stores the return volume. A controlled initial pressure is central to avoiding cavitation and electrical failure.

              The open precursor manuscript specifies a 200 mm pump coupon built around a 1.2 mm mandrel, six TPU filaments, and two continuous 80 micrometre copper-wire electrodes. That is enough to establish winding, fusion, sealing, and metrology before the lab attempts a closed-loop muscle.

              This baseline reproduces the fiber pump only. It does not fill in the still-unpublished actuator materials, demonstration lengths, working-fluid volume, bias pressure, sealing procedure, drive limits, or lifetime distribution of the 2026 system.
